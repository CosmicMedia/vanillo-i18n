This repository contains the translation files for [Vanillo](https://vanillo.tv)

Thank you for your interest in helping make Vanillo accessible to everyone!

## Setting up

1. Clone this repository (`$ git clone https://github.com/cosmicmedia/vanillo-i18n`)
2. Open this repository in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
3. Install the VS Code extension `i18n Ally`.
4. To ensure you follow our style guide, we recommend you install the `EditorConfig` extension too

Both of these extensions should be recommended to you by VS Code when opening the repository.

## Translating

Navigating to the i18n Ally tab on your sidebar, you should now see each language as well as the missing keys (if any) from each language.

If you're starting a translation for a language, create a file with the [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) + `.json` (i.e. `en.json`, `fr.json`). At this point, you can begin translating through i18n Ally.
